    "# Ramping\n",
    "Even with robust numerical solvers and thoughtfully chosen default tolerances, simulations may occasionally fail under certain conditions. This is often due to either inconsistent initial conditions or stiffness issues that prevent proper initialization from a rested state. While our solvers are designed to handle many scenarios effectively, the following issues may still arise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inconsistent initial conditions:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Many solvers are capable of detecting and resolving inconsistent initial conditions before taking the first step. However, this feature can be disabled, allowing bad initial conditions to be passed to the solver, and generally resulting in failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stiff problems:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Some problems are inherently stiff and cannot be initialized effectively, even with a solver's initialization correction schemes. In such cases, the solver may have difficulty determining a stable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, introducing a ramped load can stabilize the simulation. By default, `thevenin` models are set to always ask the solver to correct the initial condition. The starting guess that gets passed to the solver is always a rested condition. Therefore, ramped loads can gradually adjust from the initial state to the desired load, making them easier for the solver to handle. This technique helps avoid the solver crashing due to an abrupt change in load.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use the `loadfns` module to create a ramped load profile. While we will focus one specific function, other useful helper functions are available in the `loadfns` module, and we encourage you to explore the full documentation for more information."

    "Aside from a constant ramp, like `Ramp` demonstrated above, ramps are also commonly used to quickly move from a rested state to a constant load. This can help with solver stability over trying to instantaneously pull a load. To build this type of provile, use the `Ramp2Constant` class. Below, we ramp up to a 20 C discharge in one millisecond and then hold the 20 C discharge rate until 3 V."
