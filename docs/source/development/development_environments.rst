Development Environments
========================
This guide will walk you through setting up a local development environment for contributing to ``thevenin``. It covers recommended practices, tools, and commands for developers to efficiently build, test, and contribute to the project.

.. note:: 

    We assume developers are already at least a little familiar with using git and GitHub. If this is not the case for you, there are many online tutorials to help you `learn git <https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github>`_.

1. Fork and clone the repository
    Before setting up your local environment, make sure you have forked the main repository and cloned it from your own fork. This allows you to create pull requests from your fork to the main repo.

2. Create a virtual environment
    While developers can use any virtual environment manager, we recommend using ``conda`` if you are not already using a virtual environment tool. You can install `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`_ if needed to setup ``conda`` on your machine.

    Development should be done using the latest stable release of Python, so please setup your virtual environment accordingly. Continuous Integration (CI) workflows automatically test older versions. On occasion, if issues arise during tests, you may need to work with older Python versions temporarily.

3. Install ``thevenin`` in editable mode
    Once you have your virtual environment activated and the files locally available, install ``thevenin`` in editable mode, including the necessary development tools and dependencies, like so::

        pip install -e .[dev]

    * Make sure you are in the same folder as the ``pyproject.toml`` file when you run this command.
    * The ``-e`` flag ensures that any changes made locally will be immediately available without reinstalling.
    * The ``[dev]`` argument installs all developer dependencies like linters, spellcheckers, and testing tools.

4. Running tests 
    We recommend testing your installation before you start making changes. To run unit tests and make a coverage report, we have integrated ``nox``::

        nox -s tests 

    This will run all tests and generate coverage reports. You can see the coverage report by opening the ``index.html`` file in the ``reports/htmlcov/`` folder once the tests are finished.

5. Linting, formatting, and spellchecking
    All linting, formatting, and spellchecking tasks are automated. To run these checks locally::

        nox -s linter [-- format]
        nox -s codespell [-- write]
    
    The optional ``format`` and ``write`` arguments will attempt to format the code and correct misspellings, respectively. For more information on linting and code style, make sure you reference the :doc:`code_style_and_linting` section.

6. Building documentation
    We use `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to build documentation by scraping docstrings. Before you start modifying the code base, make sure the documentation builds locally::

        nox -s docs 

    You can see the local documentation build in your browser by opening the ``index.html`` file from the ``sphinx/build/`` folder.

Now that you're all setup with a development version of ``thevenin`` and have tested the codebase using the ``nox`` integration, be sure to follow the :doc:`version_control` workflow as you contribute. Happy coding!
